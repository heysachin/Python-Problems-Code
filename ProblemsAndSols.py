#<-------- Part 1 Fundamentals --------->

#              Basics



# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output). Go to the editor
# Sample String : "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are" 
# Output :
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
#     How I wonder what you are! 
#         Up above the world so high,
#         Like a diamond in the sky. 
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
#     How I wonder what you are
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Hints
# Using \n (newline) and \t (tab) to format the string
print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are! \n\t\tUp above the world so high, \n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky. \nTwinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are!")

year = str((2014 - age)+100)
